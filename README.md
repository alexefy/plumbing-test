# Victoria Frontend Test

This project is built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. 

## Installation
To install the package, use `npm i`.

## Development
To run the project in development mode, use `npm run dev`.

## Linting and Testing
ESLint and Jest are also configured. To lint the code, use `npm run lint`. To run the tests, use `npm run test`.

## Approach
I used Next.js to take advantage of its routing, which helped with implementing the pagination feature. I've broken down the application into components where possible and used correct markup and accessible options where applicable. Overall, I believe this is a fair test, and I have done enough to showcase my understanding within the given time frame. I spent a total of 4 hours on this test.

## Improvements
In retrospect, I could have aimed to match the design a little more closely and added a few more tests to improve code coverage.
